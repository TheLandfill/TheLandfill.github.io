			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>
				I have two categories for designs: mockups that have yet to be
				made into official websites and official websites. The mockups
				will be hosted here, but if I've made an official website, I'll
				also link to it. As this is currently a static site, I won't be
				able to implement any server code in any mockups.
			</p>
			<p>
			</p>
			<h3>Mockups</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/designs/mindandbodyconnections/">Mind and Body
				Connections LLC</a>
					<ul>
						<li>$50 - $80</li>
						<li>Single Page Application</li>
						<li>Completely static site with no server side code
						(i.e. no user databases, shopping carts, payment
						handling, etc.)</li>
						<li>Not set up to be updated frequently</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Official Websites</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://tuacm.com/blog/c-language/word-counter/">Example article from TUACM.com</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Request a Website</h2>
			<p>
				If you would like me to design a website for you, <a
				href="mailto:the.landfill.coding@gmail.com?subject=Request
				Website">email me</a> and we'll discuss rates.
			</p>
			<h3>Pricing</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="warning">DISCLAIMER: The price I charge you does
				not include paying for a web domain, the server, or any plan
				from an ISP to serve your website. You will have to pay for it
				on your own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="warning">DISCLAIMER: All prices given here are
				reasonable estimates that should cover most cases, but these
				prices could be higher or lower depending on the amount of
				effort I have to put into the design. I reserve the right to
				decide the final price based on what you specify in the
				design.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				As a baseline, $50 for a well-designed static website that works
				on desktop, tablet, and mobile in all browsers that you don't
				plan to update frequently, $100 if you want a static website
				that does fancy things (including a website you update
				frequently, has a moderate amount of JavaScript/user
				interaction) or if you want some basic server side code (i.e.
				basic user databases, shopping carts, payment handling, a
				counter to indicate how many times someone has visited your
				website, etc.), and $200 if you want a fancy website with basic
				server side code. Anything more complicated than that will
				require at least $200 and depends on what exactly you want me to
				implement. I may not be able to implement your website and I
				will let you know as soon as possible so you can find someone
				else.
			</p>
			<p>
				The actual price of your website will vary between these prices
				depending on the complexity of the work. For example, if you
				want a static website with a little pizzaz or some animations,
				the price will be above $50 but less than $100. If you want a
				little server code (say enough to show a counter for the number
				of the users that have visited your site), then the price will
				be between $50 and $150, but most likely less than $100.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount of effort I have to put into the design could lead to
				up to a $30 design cost. If you specify most of the design and
				layout and I just have to write the website, then I will not
				charge you a design cost. I refuse to make a design without a
				basic specification, as I want to avoid the scenario where a
				customer requests X, I make X, and then the customer tells me he
				or she wanted Y.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount of effort I have to put into making sure you can
				update your website could lead to up to a $30 set up cost. If I
				only have to send you the files for the website, then I will not
				charge you a set up cost. If I have to figure out how to set up
				your server or I have to set up your website so that you can
				make frequent updates, then I will charge you more.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want a redesign of a website I have already made for you,
				I will treat it as if you wanted another website, but I will
				offer a reduced price depending on the amount of effort I would
				need to put into the redesign. For example, if you just want me
				to change the colorscheme, move things around slightly, change
				some fonts, or add another button, I could do it for about $5 -
				$20. If you want to completely change the layout, $20 - $50. If
				you want me to add some server side functionality to a website
				you originally specified as static, $50 - $200.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you put a visible link to this webpage in a prominent part of
				the website (on every page such as in the footer), I will offer
				a 10% discount on the final cost. If you put a visible link to
				this webpage on a prominent page within the website (say the
				about page or the home page), I will offer a 5% discount. For
				design reasons, I do not recommend doing both, and so I will
				only offer one of these discounts at a time.
			</p>

			<h3>Payment</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, I am using Paypal to receive payments. If you don't
				have a Paypal account, you can set one up free of charge by
				following <a
				href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/how-paypal-works/how-to-setup-account">these
				instructions from Paypal</a>. In the receipt, I will list all
				the specific charges for ease of refunding.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do not offer to pay me in exposure.
			</p>
			<h3>Design Process</h3>
			<p>
				As expected, the more complicated the website, the more time it
				will take me to build it. For a simple static site, expect 2 - 4
				days. For a more complicated site, it could take up to a month.
				I will notify you of the expected timeframe as soon as possible.
				If I cannot build the website, I will tell you as soon as
				possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will send me your domain, everything you want on the
				website, and as much of the design as you have. I will discuss
				whether I can implement the website as you want it and suggest
				changes that would be easier to implement and maintain. I will
				create a mockup and send the link to you for your approval. If
				you have any design requests (such as changing the color scheme,
				changing the placement of certain parts of the webpage, etc.),
				then I will implement those changes and send you an updated
				version for your approval. We will repeat this process until we
				reach an agreement or either one of us decides to back out.
			</p>
			<p>
				After you are satisfied with the website I have made, I will
				make sure that you can update your website to the website I
				have made, usually by implementing a dummy version without the
				design. <b>Only after I have made the website and made sure that
				you can update your website will I charge you</b>. After you
				have paid me, I will do what I need to do to set your website
				up.
			</p>
			<h3>Refunds</h3>
			<p>
				If you notice an error, glitch, etc. in the website I made
				within a month of the transaction, I will do what I can to fix
				it for free. If I cannot fix it within two months, I will refund
				the transaction unless you grant me an extension. <b>I will not
				refund a difference in how you wanted the website with the
				website I made if the difference could have been known at the
				time of the transaction</b>. For example, if you request a fix
				for free because the layout is different than what you wanted
				but you accepted the transaction, I will refuse. On the other
				hand, if you request a fix because something about the website
				acted unexpectedly (say the mobile version is misaligned if the
				content takes up too much vertical space), then I will fix it
				for free within two months or refund the transaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the fix requires significantly more work than specified in
				the original transaction, I will renegotiate a deal at a
				discount. If I can't fix it, I will refund all parts of the
				website that are broken. For example, if the front-end of the
				website is fine but the database is broken, then I will refund
				the cost of setting up the database but not the cost of setting
				up the front-end of the website.
			</p>
			<p>
				I reserve the right to refuse to fix something for free if the
				problem lies with a change in any external code, including
				another website's API, an update in a browser, a change in any
				library or framework used in building the site, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				This transaction is immune from the <a
				href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0176-buyers-remorse-when-ftcs-cooling-rule-may-help#exceptions">Cooling-Off
				Rule</a> as it happens entirely online.
			</p>

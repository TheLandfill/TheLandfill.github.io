			<p>It looks like I got the layout mostly down. I just need to add the
				footer and then I should be good. From there, I need to set up the
				color scheme of the website so that it's not just black, white, and
				grey. I strongly prefer red, but I feel like blue might look more
				professional. Pastels might look nice, but I think I'll use my vim
				colorscheme as a base for the colors to use. That should be enough
				text to get the idea across.
